title: "Validated H₇ (Evolutionary Progression) Component for Historical K(t) Coherence Index"
abstract: >
  This dataset provides a validated empirical operationalization of the H₇
  (Evolutionary Progression) component of the historical K(t) coherence index,
  integrating four dimensions of societal advancement: education, innovation
  (patents), infrastructure, and governance. The dataset covers 159 countries
  from 1996-2021 (2,352 observations) and demonstrates that direct empirical
  measurement yields more conservative assessments than demographic proxies,
  strengthening scientific credibility through methodological rigor. Includes
  complete data pipeline (191,913 raw data points from World Bank), processing
  scripts, and K(t) framework integration demonstrating -7.0% conservative
  difference from synthetic approaches.

# Usage notes
notes: >
  This dataset replaces exploratory synthetic H₇ proxies with validated empirical
  measures. The conservative finding (-7.0% lower K(t)) strengthens scientific
  credibility by demonstrating commitment to empirical honesty over result inflation.

  Dual formulation strategy: Use six-harmony K(t) for historical periods (1810-1995)
  where validated H₇ data are unavailable; use seven-harmony K(t) with validated
  H₇ for modern period (1996-2021) where direct measures exist.

  All data sources are publicly available (World Bank CC-BY-4.0). Complete
  reproducibility in <10 minutes using provided Nix environment.
