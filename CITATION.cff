title: "Historical K-Index Research Program: Global Coordination Capacity 1810-2020"
abstract: >
  The Historical K-Index Research Program quantifies global coordination capacity
  from 1810-2020 using seven fundamental harmonies: governance, interconnection,
  reciprocity, complexity, knowledge, wellbeing, and evolutionary progression.
  This repository contains complete replication materials for a trilogy of papers:
  (1) Foundation paper establishing the K-index framework and validating all seven
  harmonies (1810-2020), (2) Regional divergence analysis examining coordination
  gaps across developed and developing regions, and (3) Temporal shocks study of
  crisis impacts on coordination resilience. Includes 191,913 raw data points,
  complete processing pipeline, and all figures/tables for Nature Sustainability
  submission.

  abstract: >-
    We present a comprehensive framework for quantifying global coordination
    capacity from 1810-2020 using seven fundamental harmonies. The K-index
    integrates governance quality, economic interconnection, reciprocity,
    complexity, knowledge systems, wellbeing, and evolutionary progression
    into a unified measure of humanity's capacity for large-scale cooperation.

# Usage notes
notes: >
  This repository contains complete replication materials for a trilogy of papers
  examining global coordination capacity. Data files (~2.5 GB) are excluded from
  Git and available via Zenodo or download scripts. The repository uses a monorepo
  structure with shared data/code resources and paper-specific materials.

  **For Paper 1 users**: Complete K(t) time series 1810-2020 with all seven harmonies
  validated. Use shared/data/processed/k_index_final_1810_2020.csv as primary dataset.

  **For Paper 2 users**: Regional analysis builds on Paper 1 framework. Data structures
  support sub-national breakdowns where available.

  **For Paper 3 users**: Event study methodology uses same K(t) time series with
  high-frequency estimates during crisis periods.

  All data sources are publicly available with open licenses (primarily CC-BY-4.0).
  Complete reproducibility using provided Nix environment: `nix develop`.
