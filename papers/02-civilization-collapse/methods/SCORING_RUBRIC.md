# Standardized Scoring Rubric for Harmony Assessment

> **"A semi-quantitative approach demands systematic scoring criteria to ensure inter-case comparability."**

---

## Purpose

This document provides standardized scoring criteria for assessing each of the seven harmonies (H₁-H₇) across all case studies. The goal is to ensure:

1. **Consistency**: Same evidence → same score across cases
2. **Transparency**: Reviewers can understand and critique scoring decisions
3. **Reproducibility**: Independent researchers can replicate assessments
4. **Calibration**: Ancient cases benchmarked against modern data

### H₃ Threshold Identification

The threshold (θ ≈ 0.35-0.40) is identified by:
1. **Historical pattern**: Cases crossing below this level collapsed

## Cross-Case Calibration

### Anchor Points

To ensure comparability, we use anchor points—scores that should be consistent across cases:

| Score | Ancient Anchor | Modern Anchor |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 0.85 | Roman peak (200 CE) | OECD average today |
| 0.65 | Late Rome (350 CE) | Middle-income country |
| 0.45 | Late Rome (400 CE) | Fragile state |
| 0.25 | Post-Rome (500 CE) | Failed state |

### Modern Calibration

Where survey data exists (Soviet case), we directly measure H₃:
- WVS trust question: "Most people can be trusted" (%)
- Convert to 0-1 scale: Score = Trust% × weighting factors

This calibrates our proxy-based ancient estimates.

---

## Scoring Protocol

### Step 1: Evidence Compilation
- Gather all available evidence for the period
- Weight by evidence type (see table above)
- Note gaps and uncertainties

### Step 2: Initial Assessment
- Assign preliminary score based on criteria
- Document reasoning
- Identify key evidence driving score

### Step 3: Cross-Check
- Compare to adjacent periods (trajectory should be coherent)
- Compare to control case (should differ appropriately)
- Compare to other cases at similar phase (should be comparable)

### Step 4: Confidence Assessment
- Rate evidence quality
- Assign confidence interval
- Note major uncertainties

### Step 5: Documentation
- Record score, confidence, and reasoning
- Flag any controversial interpretations
- Note alternative scoring possibilities

---

## Sensitivity Testing

For each case, we assess sensitivity to:

1. **Evidence interpretation**: Alternative readings of key evidence
2. **Weighting schemes**: Different harmony weights
3. **Threshold values**: θ = 0.35 vs 0.40 vs 0.45
4. **Temporal boundaries**: Different periodization
5. **Case inclusion**: Effects of removing each case

Report sensitivity range for key findings.

---

## Reviewer Guidance

### What Reviewers Should Check

1. **Evidence support**: Is each score defensible given available evidence?
2. **Cross-case consistency**: Are similar situations scored similarly?
3. **Trajectory coherence**: Do scores change appropriately over time?
4. **Control case contrast**: Do survivors score higher than collapsed?
5. **Documentation quality**: Is reasoning transparent?

### Anticipated Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Scores are subjective" | Systematic rubric + transparency + sensitivity testing |
| "Ancient data insufficient" | Multiple lines of evidence; Soviet validates methodology |
| "Different cases not comparable" | Anchor points + modern calibration |
| "Thresholds are arbitrary" | Empirically derived from case pattern + control comparison |
