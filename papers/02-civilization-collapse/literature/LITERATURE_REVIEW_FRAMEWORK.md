# Literature Review Framework: Civilization Collapse

**Purpose**: Systematic review of collapse literature through K-Index lens

---

## Review Strategy

For each source, extract:
1. **Collapse factors identified** (map to H₁-H₇)
2. **Timing/sequence data** (what failed first?)
3. **Quantitative indicators** (if available)
4. **Recovery information** (if applicable)
5. **Methodological approach** (can we apply similar methods?)

## Section 1: Collapse Theory (Foundation)

### 1.1 Classic Works

#### Tainter, J.A. (1988). *The Collapse of Complex Societies*
**Core Argument**: Collapse = declining marginal returns on complexity investment
**K-Index Mapping**:
- Complexity = H₄ (Economic Complexity)
- Investment in complexity = building H₁-H₇
- Diminishing returns = harmony imbalances

**Key Insights**:
- Collapse is a political process (H₁)
- Complexity is costly to maintain
- Societies don't "choose" collapse - they can't afford alternatives

**Quotes to Use**:
- [Extract key quotes]

**Critique**: Focuses on complexity (H₄) but underweights trust (H₃)

---

#### Diamond, J. (2005). *Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed*
**Core Argument**: Five-factor framework (environment, climate, neighbors, trade, society's responses)
**K-Index Mapping**:
- Environment/Climate = external shocks to H₆, H₇
- Neighbors = H₂ (interconnection), H₃ (trust)
- Trade = H₂
- Society's responses = H₁ (governance)

**Key Insights**:
- Environmental factors often trigger but don't determine collapse
- Social responses (coordination) mediate outcomes
- Comparative method across cases

**Critique**: Too deterministic about environment; underweights institutional factors

---

#### Turchin, P. (2006). *War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires*
**Core Argument**: Secular cycles driven by elite overproduction, popular immiseration
**K-Index Mapping**:
- Elite overproduction = H₃ breakdown (intra-elite competition)
- Popular immiseration = H₆ decline
- Asabiyyah (social cohesion) = H₃

**Key Insights**:
- Cycles of ~200-300 years in complex societies
- Elite competition as key driver of H₃ collapse
- Quantitative approach to historical dynamics

**Data Sources Cited**: Can we use same sources?

---

#### Turchin, P. & Nefedov, S. (2009). *Secular Cycles*
**Core Argument**: Demographic-structural theory of pre-industrial state collapse
**K-Index Mapping**:
- Population dynamics → H₆
- State finances → H₁
- Elite dynamics → H₃
- Popular unrest → H₃ breakdown

**Quantitative Data**: Population estimates, price series, state revenues
**Cases Covered**: Rome, France, England, Russia

---

### 1.2 Complexity Science Approaches

#### Scheffer, M. (2009). *Critical Transitions in Nature and Society*
**Core Argument**: Complex systems show early warning signals before tipping points
**K-Index Application**:
- Coordination capacity as complex system
- Harmonies as interacting components
- K(t) approaching threshold = critical transition

**Early Warning Signals**:
- Increased variance (harmonies diverging)
- Slower recovery from perturbations
- Increased autocorrelation

**Methodological Value**: Can we detect these signals in historical K(t)?

---

#### Scheffer, M. et al. (2012). "Anticipating Critical Transitions" *Science*
**Key Points**:
- Generic early warning signals for critical transitions
- Applicable across domains (ecology, finance, climate, society)
- Mathematical framework for tipping points

**Application to K-Index**:
- Monitor K(t) variance and autocorrelation
- Identify approaching thresholds
- Design intervention triggers

---

#### Centeno, M.A. et al. (2015). "The Emergence of Global Systemic Risk"
**Core Argument**: Modern interconnection creates systemic fragility
**K-Index Mapping**:
- H₂ (interconnection) can amplify H₃ shocks
- Network structure matters for collapse propagation
- Global vs local collapse dynamics

---

### 1.3 Archaeological Theory

#### Middleton, G. (2017). *Understanding Collapse: Ancient History and Modern Myths*
**Core Argument**: Collapse is often exaggerated; transformation more common
**K-Index Implications**:
- Distinguish collapse from transformation
- Regional variation within "collapse"
- Recovery and continuity alongside decline

**Methodological Caution**: Avoid overdramatizing; be precise about what collapsed

---

#### McAnany, P.A. & Yoffee, N. (eds.) (2010). *Questioning Collapse*
**Core Argument**: Critique of Diamond; collapse narratives often oversimplified
**Key Points**:
- Indigenous perspectives on "collapse"
- Continuity of populations if not institutions
- Political agendas in collapse narratives

**For Our Paper**: Acknowledge complexity; focus on coordination institutions, not populations

---

## Section 2: Bronze Age Collapse

### 2.1 Primary Sources

#### Cline, E. (2014). *1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed*
**Core Argument**: Perfect storm of factors, not single cause
**Factors Identified**:
- Climate change (drought)
- Earthquakes
- Sea Peoples invasions
- Trade disruption
- Internal rebellions

**K-Index Mapping**:
| Factor | Harmony |
|--------|---------|
| Climate/drought | H₆ stress, H₇ (agriculture infrastructure) |
| Earthquakes | H₇ damage |
| Sea Peoples | H₂ disruption, H₃ external threat |
| Trade collapse | H₂ → 0 |
| Internal rebellions | H₃ breakdown, H₁ failure |

**Chronology**: ~1250-1150 BCE, with peak disruption ~1177 BCE
**Geographic Scope**: Eastern Mediterranean interconnected system

**Key Quote**: "It was a 'systems collapse,' with a domino effect, as the disintegration of one civilization led to the fall of the others"

---

#### Knapp, A.B. & Manning, S.W. (2016). "Crisis in Context: The End of the Late Bronze Age in the Eastern Mediterranean" *American Journal of Archaeology*
**Core Argument**: Need site-level, regionally-differentiated analysis

- High-resolution chronology
- Site-by-site collapse sequences
- Identifies regional variation

**Data Sources**: Radiocarbon dating, ceramic sequences, destruction layers

---

#### Kaniewski, D. et al. (2013). "Environmental Roots of the Late Bronze Age Crisis" *PLOS ONE*
**Core Argument**: Climate data supports drought as trigger
**Evidence**:
- Pollen cores showing aridification
- ~1200 BCE climate shift documented
- Regional correlation with collapse sites

**K-Index Application**: Environmental stress → H₆ (wellbeing), H₇ (agriculture)
**But**: Climate didn't cause collapse; coordination failure did

---

- Literacy decline (H₅)
- Population decline (H₆)

**Quantitative Data**:
- Pottery distribution (maps of H₂ decline)
- Coin circulation
- Roof tile production (proxy for construction)

**Key Quote**: "The end of the Roman world brought levels of material sophistication that would not be matched again in the West for centuries"

---

#### Wickham, C. (2009). *The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages, 400-1000*
**Core Argument**: Regional variation; some areas maintained complexity
**Nuance for Our Paper**:
- Not uniform collapse everywhere
