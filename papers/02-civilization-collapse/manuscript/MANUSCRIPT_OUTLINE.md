## 1. Introduction (~1,500 words)

### 1.1 The Puzzle of Civilizational Collapse (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Collapse is a recurring pattern in complex societies
- Examples span geography and time (Bronze Age, Rome, Maya, etc.)
- Despite extensive study, collapse remains poorly predicted
- Modern societies may face similar vulnerabilities

**Opening Hook** (draft):
> In 1177 BCE, the interconnected civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean—Egyptian, Hittite, Mycenaean, Cypriot, Levantine—collapsed in a cascade that scholars have called "the worst disaster in ancient history." Within a generation, palace economies that had traded across thousands of miles fell silent. Writing systems were abandoned. Cities were burned and never rebuilt. The coordination capacity that had sustained these societies for centuries evaporated.

### 1.2 Limitations of Single-Factor Explanations (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Environmental determinism (Diamond's critique and counter-critique)
- Economic complexity focus (Tainter's diminishing returns)
- External pressure narratives (barbarian invasions, climate)
- Each captures partial truth but misses integration
- Collapse results from coordination failure across dimensions

### 1.3 Coordination Capacity as Integrative Framework (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Introduce K-Index from Paper 1
- Explain seven harmonies briefly
- Geometric mean captures fragility (single weak link vulnerability)
- Coordination is the meta-capacity enabling response to shocks
- Collapse = catastrophic K(t) decline below sustainability threshold

### 1.4 Paper Contributions and Structure (~300 words)

**Contributions**:
1. First systematic application of coordination framework to collapse
2. Comparative analysis across four collapse cases AND four matched controls
3. Identification of collapse sequence patterns with causal inference
4. Threshold estimation for complex society maintenance

**Structure Preview**:
- Section 2: Theoretical framework
- Section 3: Methods (including control case design)
- Sections 4-7: Four collapse case studies
- Section 8: Control case comparisons (Egypt, Byzantium, Northern Maya, China)
- Section 9: Cross-case analysis and causal inference

## 2. Theoretical Framework (~2,000 words)

### 2.1 The K-Index Framework (~600 words)

**Content**:
- Summary of Paper 1 methodology
- Seven harmonies defined:
  - H₁: Governance Coherence
  - H₂: Economic Interconnection
  - H₃: Cooperative Reciprocity (Trust)
  - H₄: Economic Complexity
  - H₅: Knowledge Systems
  - H₆: Wellbeing Metrics
  - H₇: Technological Infrastructure
- Geometric mean formula: K(t) = (∏Hᵢ)^(1/7)
- Why geometric mean matters for fragility

### 2.2 Applying Coordination Framework to Collapse (~600 words)

**Content**:
- Collapse as coordination failure
- Different from single-system failure
- Cascade dynamics when harmonies interact
- Recovery asymmetry (rebuilding trust slower than destroying it)
- Historical vs. modern collapse patterns

### 2.3 Hypotheses (~400 words)

**Hypothesis 1** (H₃ First):
> Trust and reciprocity (H₃) typically erode FIRST in collapse sequences.
- Rationale: Trust is foundational; enables all other coordination

**Hypothesis 2** (H₇ Last):
> Technological infrastructure (H₇) persists LONGEST.
- Rationale: Physical infrastructure outlasts social organization

**Hypothesis 3** (Speed-Capacity Correlation):
> Collapse speed is inversely correlated with pre-crisis K(t).
- Rationale: Higher coordination provides resilience buffers

**Hypothesis 4** (Recovery Asymmetry):
> Recovery takes 3-10x longer than collapse.
- Rationale: Trust rebuilding is slower than destruction

**Hypothesis 5** (Minimum Threshold):
> Minimum viable K(t) for complex society ≈ 0.3-0.4.
- Rationale: Below threshold, cascading failures become irreversible

### 2.4 Methodological Approach (~400 words)

**Content**:
- Case selection criteria (data availability, collapse severity, temporal scope)
- Harmony reconstruction from historical proxies
- Scoring rubric summary (reference supplementary)
- Temporal resolution and periodization

**Shared Stressors**:
- Sea Peoples attacks (Ramesses III battles, ~1178 BCE)
- Drought conditions (Nile low, grain stress)
- Trade network disruption
- Regional instability

**Why Egypt Survived**:
- **H₁ (Governance)**: Centralized pharaonic authority maintained
- **H₃ (Trust)**: Religious legitimacy + divine kingship
- **H₇ (Infrastructure)**: Nile-based system more resilient than trade-dependent economies

**K(t) Comparison**:
| Metric | Mycenae | Egypt |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Pre-crisis K(t) | 0.65 | 0.70 |
| H₃ at crisis | 0.3 (failed) | 0.5 (stressed but maintained) |
| Post-crisis K(t) | 0.15 | 0.50 |
| Outcome | Collapse | Survival (Third Intermediate Period) |

**Why Northern Cities Survived**:
- **H₃ (Trust)**: Different political organization (less divine kingship, more collective)
- **H₂ (Trade)**: Coastal trade networks maintained (maritime connections)
- **H₇ (Infrastructure)**: Different water management (cenotes vs. reservoirs)
- **H₄ (Complexity)**: Economic diversification (salt, trade goods)

**K(t) Comparison**:
| Metric | Tikal (South) | Chichen Itza (North) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Pre-crisis K(t) | 0.60 | 0.55 |
| H₃ at crisis | 0.25 (collapsed) | 0.45 (maintained) |
| Post-crisis K(t) | 0.10 | 0.55 |

- **Adaptation**: Economic liberalization without political liberalization

**K(t) Comparison**:
| Metric | Soviet Union | China |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Pre-crisis K(t) (1985) | 0.55 | 0.50 |
| H₃ at crisis (1989) | 0.30 (collapsed inter-republic trust) | 0.40 (stressed but maintained) |
| Post-crisis K(t) (1995) | 0.30 (fragmented) | 0.55 (recovered) |
| Outcome | Dissolved | Survived and grew |

**Key Insight**: China's centralized structure and economic reform strategy maintained sufficient H₃.

### 8.5 Control Case Synthesis (~200 words)

**Pattern Across All Controls**:
- All faced similar stressors to matched collapse cases
- All maintained H₃ above ~0.40-0.45 threshold
- All showed adaptive capacity in governance (H₁)
- None suffered the complete H₃ failure seen in collapse cases

**Causal Inference Strengthened**:
> "The consistent pattern—collapse cases falling below H₃ threshold while matched controls maintained H₃ above threshold despite similar stressors—supports the causal role of trust erosion in coordination collapse."

- Implications for intervention timing

### 9.5 Causal Inference: Why H₃ Matters (~700 words) 🆕

**Five Lines of Evidence for Causation**:

**1. Temporal Precedence**:
- Across all four collapse cases, H₃ decline preceded other harmony declines
- Average lag: H₃ → H₁ (~25 years), H₃ → H₂ (~20 years)
- Consistent with trust as enabling condition for other coordination

**2. Mechanism Identification**:
- H₃↓ → Elite competition → H₁↓ (governance)
- H₃↓ → Trade partner defection → H₂↓ (networks)
- H₃↓ → Investment withdrawal → H₄↓ (complexity)
- H₃↓ → Brain drain → H₅↓ (knowledge)

**3. Control Case Comparison**:
- All controls maintained H₃ > 0.40 during crisis
- All collapse cases fell below H₃ < 0.35
- Similar stressors, different H₃ outcomes → different results

**4. Counterfactual Analysis**:
- Historical near-misses where H₃ interventions prevented cascade
- Examples: Treaty renewals, reconciliation efforts, legitimacy reforms

**5. Process Tracing**:
- Case-by-case documentation of trust breakdown → cascade → collapse
- Contemporary sources describe trust erosion as pivotal

**Causal Conclusion**:
> "While correlation cannot prove causation, the convergence of temporal precedence, mechanism identification, control comparisons, counterfactual analysis, and process tracing provides strong evidence that H₃ erosion is causally central to coordination collapse."
