### Draft Elements

**Background** (2 sentences):

## 1. Introduction (~1,500 words)

### 1.1 The Puzzle of Civilizational Collapse (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Collapse is a recurring pattern in complex societies
- Examples span geography and time (Bronze Age, Rome, Maya, etc.)
- Despite extensive study, collapse remains poorly predicted
- Modern societies may face similar vulnerabilities

**Opening Hook** (draft):
> In 1177 BCE, the interconnected civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean—Egyptian, Hittite, Mycenaean, Cypriot, Levantine—collapsed in a cascade that scholars have called "the worst disaster in ancient history." Within a generation, palace economies that had traded across thousands of miles fell silent. Writing systems were abandoned. Cities were burned and never rebuilt. The coordination capacity that had sustained these societies for centuries evaporated.

### 1.2 Limitations of Single-Factor Explanations (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Environmental determinism (Diamond's critique and counter-critique)
- Economic complexity focus (Tainter's diminishing returns)
- External pressure narratives (barbarian invasions, climate)
- Each captures partial truth but misses integration
- Collapse results from coordination failure across dimensions

### 1.3 Coordination Capacity as Integrative Framework (~400 words)

**Key Points**:
- Introduce K-Index from Paper 1
- Explain seven harmonies briefly
- Geometric mean captures fragility (single weak link vulnerability)
- Coordination is the meta-capacity enabling response to shocks
- Collapse = catastrophic K(t) decline below sustainability threshold

### 1.4 Paper Contributions and Structure (~300 words)

**Contributions**:
1. First systematic application of coordination framework to collapse
2. Comparative analysis across four cases
3. Identification of collapse sequence patterns
4. Threshold estimation for complex society maintenance
5. Framework for modern fragility assessment

**Structure Preview**:
- Section 2: Theoretical framework
- Sections 3-6: Four case studies
- Section 7: Cross-case analysis
- Section 8: Discussion
- Section 9: Conclusion

## 2. Theoretical Framework (~2,000 words)

### 2.1 The K-Index Framework (~600 words)

**Content**:
- Summary of Paper 1 methodology
- Seven harmonies defined:
  - H₁: Governance Coherence
  - H₂: Economic Interconnection
  - H₃: Cooperative Reciprocity (Trust)
  - H₄: Economic Complexity
  - H₅: Knowledge Systems
  - H₆: Wellbeing Metrics
  - H₇: Technological Infrastructure
- Geometric mean formula: K(t) = (∏Hᵢ)^(1/7)
- Why geometric mean matters for fragility

### 2.2 Applying Coordination Framework to Collapse (~600 words)

**Content**:
- Collapse as coordination failure
- Different from single-system failure
- Cascade dynamics when harmonies interact
- Recovery asymmetry (rebuilding trust slower than destroying it)
- Historical vs. modern collapse patterns

### 2.3 Hypotheses (~400 words)

**Hypothesis 1** (H₃ First):
> Trust and reciprocity (H₃) typically erode FIRST in collapse sequences.
- Rationale: Trust is foundational; enables all other coordination

**Hypothesis 2** (H₇ Last):
> Technological infrastructure (H₇) persists LONGEST.
- Rationale: Physical infrastructure outlasts social organization

**Hypothesis 3** (Speed-Capacity Correlation):
> Collapse speed is inversely correlated with pre-crisis K(t).
- Rationale: Higher coordination provides resilience buffers

**Hypothesis 4** (Recovery Asymmetry):
> Recovery takes 3-10x longer than collapse.
- Rationale: Trust rebuilding is slower than destruction

**Hypothesis 5** (Minimum Threshold):
> Minimum viable K(t) for complex society ≈ 0.3-0.4.
- Rationale: Below threshold, cascading failures become irreversible

### 2.4 Methodological Approach (~400 words)

**Content**:
- Case selection criteria (data availability, collapse severity, temporal scope)
- Harmony reconstruction from historical proxies
- Scoring rubric summary (reference supplementary)
- Temporal resolution and periodization
