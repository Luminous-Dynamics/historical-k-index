- Military anarchy, economic disruption
- Temporary recovery under Diocletian

### Phase 3: Managed Decline (284-395 CE)
- Tetrarchy and division
- Constantine and Christianity
- Growing regional divergence

### Phase 4: Collapse (395-476 CE)
- Permanent East-West division
- Barbarian invasions intensify
- Western empire dissolution

### Phase 5: Post-Collapse (476-600 CE)
- Ostrogothic Italy
- Merovingian Gaul

## H₇ Technological Infrastructure

### Key Indicators

| Indicator | Data Source | Time Range | Scoring Approach |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------------|

3. **Building Archaeological Reports**
4. **Military Equipment Studies**

### Evidence for Infrastructure Persistence

**Roads** (H₇ persists longest):
- Road network: Still usable through 6th century
- Maintenance: Declining but ongoing in key areas
- Later reuse: Medieval routes follow Roman

**Aqueducts**:
- Rome: Some functioning to 6th c.
- Provincial: Many abandoned by 5th c.
- Constantinople: Maintained throughout

**Buildings**:
- Spolia reuse begins 4th c.
- New construction quality declines
- Maintenance prioritized over new building

### Trajectory Estimate (PERSISTS LONGEST)

```
200 BCE - 200 CE:  0.60 → 0.90 (infrastructure building)
200 - 350 CE:      0.90 → 0.80 (maintained despite crisis)
350 - 450 CE:      0.80 → 0.65 (declining maintenance)
450 - 550 CE:      0.65 → 0.45 (accelerating decay)
550 - 600 CE:      0.45 → 0.35 (still usable in places)
```

**Key Finding**: H₇ declines last, still above 0.30 when K(t) overall < 0.20.

## Composite K(t) Trajectory

### Summary Table

| Period | H₁ | H₂ | H₃ | H₄ | H₅ | H₆ | H₇ | K(t) |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| 200 CE (Peak) | 0.90 | 0.90 | 0.75 | 0.85 | 0.80 | 0.70 | 0.90 | **0.82** |
| 284 CE (Crisis) | 0.50 | 0.55 | 0.40 | 0.65 | 0.65 | 0.50 | 0.80 | **0.56** |
| 350 CE (Recovery) | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.55 | 0.60 | 0.60 | 0.55 | 0.75 | **0.63** |
| 400 CE (Decline) | 0.55 | 0.55 | 0.45 | 0.55 | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.70 | **0.54** |
| 450 CE (Collapse) | 0.35 | 0.35 | 0.35 | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.40 | 0.55 | **0.40** |
| 476 CE (End) | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.30 | 0.30 | 0.35 | 0.45 | **0.28** |
| 550 CE (Post) | 0.20 | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.20 | 0.35 | **0.22** |

### Key Observations

1. **H₃ leads decline**: Trust falls first in each crisis phase
2. **H₇ lags**: Infrastructure persists 50-100 years after other harmonies collapse
3. **Recovery attempts visible**: Diocletian/Constantine raised K(t) but couldn't restore H₃ fully
4. **Threshold crossing**: K(t) crosses 0.40 around 450 CE → irreversible

## Control Case: Byzantine Empire

### Why Byzantium Survived

| Harmony | Western Rome | Byzantine | Key Difference |
|---------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| H₁ | Fragmented authority | Centralized bureaucracy | Stronger institutions |
| H₂ | Trade collapse | Constantinople hub | Maintained trade |
| H₃ | **0.35 (crisis)** | **0.55 (stable)** | Religious legitimacy |
| H₄ | Simplification | Continued complexity | Economic base |
| H₅ | Knowledge loss | Greek preservation | Educational continuity |
| H₆ | Population decline | Less severe | Geographic advantage |
| H₇ | Infrastructure decay | Maintained walls, water | Investment continued |

**Critical Difference**: Byzantine H₃ never fell below 0.45 during the crisis period.
