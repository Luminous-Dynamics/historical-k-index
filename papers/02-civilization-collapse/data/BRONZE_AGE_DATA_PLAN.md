# Bronze Age Collapse: Data Collection Plan

**Case Study**: Bronze Age Collapse (~1250-1150 BCE)
**Geography**: Eastern Mediterranean (Mycenaean Greece, Hittite Anatolia, Cyprus, Levant, Egypt)
**Purpose**: First case study for Coordination Collapse paper

---

## Overview

The Bronze Age Collapse (~1200-1150 BCE) represents one of history's most dramatic multi-system failures. Within 50-100 years, interconnected palace economies across the Eastern Mediterranean collapsed, resulting in:
- Destruction of major cities (Ugarit, Hattusa, Mycenae, Tiryns)
- Cessation of long-distance trade
- Loss of writing systems (Linear B, Luwian)
- Population decline and migration
- Political fragmentation

**K-Index Hypothesis**: K(t) declined from ~0.6-0.7 to ~0.1-0.2 within 50 years

## Temporal Framework

### Periodization

| Period | Date Range | Phase | Expected K(t) |

## Regional Comparison

The Bronze Age provides a natural experiment: multiple interconnected polities with varying outcomes.

| Region | Outcome | Key Factor | H₃ at Crisis |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Egypt | Survived (stressed) | Centralized trust | Maintained |
| Hittites | Collapsed | External + internal trust failure | Failed |
| Mycenaeans | Collapsed | Inter-palace competition | Failed |
| Cyprus | Partial | Trade hub resilience | Partial |
| Levant | Collapsed | Small polities, no coordination | Failed |

**Hypothesis**: Regions with maintained H₃ (trust) survived; those with H₃ failure collapsed.
