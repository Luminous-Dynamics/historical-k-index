# Bronze Age Collapse: Data Collection Plan

> **"The first 'globalized' civilization—a system of interconnected palace economies spanning the Eastern Mediterranean—collapsed within a single generation, circa 1200-1150 BCE."**

---

## Case Study Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Case Name** | Late Bronze Age Collapse |
| **Region** | Eastern Mediterranean (Mycenae, Hatti, Levant, Egypt) |
| **Temporal Scope** | 1300-1000 BCE (focus on 1200-1150 BCE collapse phase) |
| **Population Affected** | ~5-10 million across region |
| **Collapse Duration** | ~50 years (rapid by ancient standards) |
| **Type** | Systemic/catastrophic (multi-factor cascade) |
| **Control Case** | Egypt (survived, transitioned to Third Intermediate Period) |

---

## Strategic Value of This Case

### Why the Bronze Age Case is Critical

1. **First "World System" Collapse**: Interconnected palace economies = proto-globalization
2. **Multi-Civilization Scope**: Tests whether K-Index applies across cultures
3. **Trade Network Focus**: H₂ (economic) interdependence clearly visible
4. **External Shock Present**: Sea Peoples, climate, earthquakes—tests multi-causal framework
5. **Control Case Available**: Egypt survived → what was different?

### What It Demonstrates
- Interdependent systems are vulnerable to cascade effects
- H₃ erosion at multiple levels (intra-polity, inter-polity, inter-regional)
- System complexity (H₄) can become liability
- Technology (H₇) can persist beyond political collapse

## Composite K(t) Trajectory

| Period | H₁ | H₂ | H₃ | H₄ | H₅ | H₆ | H₇ | K(t) | Phase |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 1300 BCE | 0.80 | 0.75 | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.65 | 0.75 | **0.75** | Peak |
| 1250 BCE | 0.70 | 0.70 | 0.60 | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.55 | 0.70 | **0.68** | Pre-crisis |
| 1200 BCE | 0.55 | 0.50 | 0.40 | 0.55 | 0.60 | 0.40 | 0.55 | **0.50** | H₃ ≈ θ |

- **H₃ as cascade trigger**: Inter-polity trust collapse preceded systemic failure
- **H₂ amplifier**: Trade network collapse accelerated other declines
- **H₇ resilience**: Technology actually adapted (iron adoption)
- **System vulnerability**: High interdependence = high cascade risk

## Control Case: Egypt (New Kingdom → Third Intermediate Period)

### Why Egypt Survived

| Factor | Collapsed Polities | Egypt |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **H₃ at Crisis** | < 0.40 | ~0.50 |
| **Self-sufficiency** | Trade-dependent | Nile agriculture |
| **Centralization** | Distributed | Strong central state |
| **External defense** | Failed | Ramesses III victory |
| **Adaptability** | Rigid | Administrative reform |

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Agricultural independence**: Nile provided reliable food supply
2. **Geographic buffer**: Desert boundaries provided protection
3. **Military effectiveness**: Defeated Sea Peoples (Medinet Habu inscriptions)
4. **Internal cohesion**: Maintained state legitimacy
5. **Adaptive governance**: Transition to new administrative forms

### Control Case Data:
- Egypt H₃ trajectory: 0.60 (1300) → 0.50 (1200) → 0.45 (1150)
- Never crossed threshold (~0.40)
- Gradual transition vs. collapse
- Maintained literacy, bureaucracy, state functions

## Cascade Sequence Reconstruction

### Phase 1: System Stress (1250-1210 BCE)
- Environmental stress begins (drought indicators)
- Trade disruptions emerge
- Military tensions rise (Hittite-Egyptian)
- System still functional but strained

### Phase 2: Trust Erosion (1210-1200 BCE)
- Alliance networks weakening
- Inter-polity communication declining
- Internal elite competition rising
- **H₃ approaching threshold** (~0.45-0.40)

### Phase 3: Cascade Trigger (1200-1180 BCE)
- Sea Peoples pressure intensifies
- Mutual defense fails (Ugarit's unanswered letters)
- **H₃ crosses threshold** (<0.40)
- Palace destructions begin

### Phase 4: Systemic Collapse (1180-1150 BCE)
- H₃ collapse → H₁ collapse (no legitimate authority)
- H₂ collapse (trade network dissolves)
- H₄ collapses (complexity unsustainable)
- H₅ declines (scribal traditions lost)
- Self-reinforcing decline

### Phase 5: Post-Collapse Adaptation (1150+ BCE)
- Iron Age emerges
- Smaller, simpler polities
- New ethnic configurations (Israel, Phoenicia)
- Slow recovery over centuries

## Unique Contributions to CTC

The Bronze Age case offers:

1. **System-level collapse**: Not one polity but interconnected system
2. **Trade network focus**: Clear H₂ interdependence dynamics
3. **Multi-polity H₃**: Inter-state trust as critical variable
4. **External shock integration**: Sea Peoples, climate, earthquakes
5. **Speed comparison**: Fastest ancient collapse in our set

**Key Insight**: Interdependence increases both capacity (peak K) and vulnerability (cascade risk).

*"The Bronze Age collapse shows that what makes civilizations powerful—their interconnection—can also be what makes them fragile."*
