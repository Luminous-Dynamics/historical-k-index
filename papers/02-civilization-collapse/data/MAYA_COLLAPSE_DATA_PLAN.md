- 850 CE: 0.25 (commoners abandoning elites, violence endemic)
- 900 CE: 0.20 (social fabric completely torn)

**H₃ Threshold Analysis**:
- **Threshold crossing**: ~790-810 CE (H₃ drops below 0.40)
- **Cascade trigger**: Loss of commoner confidence in elite protection

## Composite K(t) Trajectory

| Period | H₁ | H₂ | H₃ | H₄ | H₅ | H₆ | H₇ | K(t) | Phase |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 650 CE | 0.85 | 0.75 | 0.70 | 0.80 | 0.85 | 0.65 | 0.75 | **0.76** | Peak |

- **H₇ resilience**: Technology persists at simpler levels
- **Collapse duration**: ~150 years (slower than Bronze Age, comparable to Rome)

## Control Case: Northern Maya (Puuc/Chichen Itza)

### Why They Survived

| Factor | Southern Lowlands | Northern Maya |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| **H₃ (Trust)** | Collapsed ~0.25 | Maintained ~0.50 |
| **Environmental stress** | Severe drought impact | Lesser impact, coastal resources |
| **Political adaptation** | Failed to reform | New governance models (councils) |
| **Trade networks** | Collapsed | Maintained coastal routes |
| **Population density** | Overexploited | Sustainable levels |

### Key Differentiators:
1. **Different political structure**: Multepal (council governance) vs. divine kingship
2. **Coastal access**: Alternative food sources, trade resilience
3. **Lower carrying capacity stress**: Less environmental degradation
4. **External connections**: Gulf Coast trade networks maintained
5. **Trust maintenance**: Less elite competition, more collaborative governance

### Control Case Data Collection:
- Track Chichen Itza monument dates (active 800-1000 CE)
- Compare settlement hierarchy persistence
- Analyze trade good distribution (continuing coastal trade)
- Note absence of fortification construction (lower H₃ stress)

## Cascade Sequence Reconstruction

### Phase 1: Pre-Crisis (650-750 CE)
- Functioning hegemonic system (Tikal-Calakmul rivalry)
- Sustainable trade networks
- Elite competition within bounds

### Phase 2: H₃ Erosion (750-800 CE)
- Intensifying inter-polity warfare (Petexbatun collapse)
- Elite competition becomes destructive
- Commoners begin losing faith in elite protection
- **Threshold approaching**: H₃ ≈ 0.45-0.50

### Phase 3: Environmental Shock (800-850 CE)
- Major droughts 810-860 CE
- Agricultural failure amplifies social stress
- Elite unable to fulfill obligations (rain rituals failed)
- **Threshold crossed**: H₃ < 0.40
- Mass abandonment of centers begins

### Phase 4: Cascade (850-900 CE)
- H₃ collapse triggers H₁ collapse (no one trusts leaders)
- H₂ collapses (trade networks abandoned)
- H₄ simplifies (institutional complexity unsustainable)
- H₅ declines (scribal class disappears)
- Self-reinforcing decline

### Phase 5: Post-Collapse (900+ CE)
- Southern lowlands depopulated
- Survivors migrate to north, coast, highlands
- Northern Maya flourishes (different model)

## Unique Contributions to CTC

The Maya case offers:

1. **Regional variation**: Internal control (North vs. South) within same culture
2. **Environmental interaction**: Clear climate-society dynamics
3. **Elite-commoner fracture**: Documented flight from centers
4. **Epigraphic precision**: Best-dated ancient collapse
5. **Intermediate duration**: Neither rapid (Bronze Age) nor protracted (Rome)

**Key Insight**: Environmental stress acts as *amplifier* of pre-existing H₃ erosion, not independent cause.

*"The Maya did not simply succumb to drought—they lost the social cohesion that might have enabled collective response to environmental challenge."*
