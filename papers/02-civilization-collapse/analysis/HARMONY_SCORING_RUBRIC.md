# Harmony Scoring Rubric for Historical Collapse Analysis

**Purpose**: Systematic methodology for reconstructing H₁-H₇ scores from archaeological, textual, and quantitative evidence

**Version**: 1.0
**Paper**: Coordination Collapse and Civilizational Decline

---

## Scoring Framework

### General Principles

1. **Scale**: All harmonies scored 0.0-1.0
2. **Temporal Resolution**: Score at meaningful intervals (varies by case)
   - Bronze Age: ~50-year intervals
   - Rome: ~25-year intervals
   - Maya: ~25-year intervals (using Long Count dates)
   - Soviet: Annual or quarterly

3. **Evidence Triangulation**: Multiple evidence types increase confidence
4. **Conservative Scoring**: When evidence is ambiguous, score conservatively
5. **Explicit Uncertainty**: Document confidence levels for each score

### Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Interpretation | Coordination State |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0.8-1.0 | Excellent | Thriving, resilient coordination |
| 0.6-0.8 | Good | Functional with some stress |
| 0.4-0.6 | Moderate | Significant strain, warning signs |
| 0.2-0.4 | Poor | Critical dysfunction, collapse imminent |
| 0.0-0.2 | Collapsed | Coordination failure, system breakdown |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Evidence Quality | Symbol |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| High | Multiple independent sources, quantitative data | ★★★ |
| Medium | Some sources, qualitative but consistent | ★★☆ |
| Low | Limited sources, inference required | ★☆☆ |
| Very Low | Speculation based on analogies | ☆☆☆ |

## Application Procedure

### Step 1: Temporal Framework

Define time periods for scoring:
- Identify key transition points from literature
- Establish consistent intervals appropriate to evidence resolution
- Document rationale for periodization

### Step 2: Evidence Compilation

For each harmony and time period:
1. Compile available evidence from literature review
2. Categorize by evidence type
3. Assess evidence quality
4. Note gaps and limitations

### Step 3: Initial Scoring

For each harmony and time period:
1. Apply rubric criteria
2. Assign score (0.0-1.0)
3. Assign confidence level (★★★ to ☆☆☆)
4. Document reasoning

### Step 4: K(t) Calculation

```
K(t) = (H₁ × H₂ × H₃ × H₄ × H₅ × H₆ × H₇)^(1/7)
```

Calculate for each time period.

### Step 5: Validation

1. **Internal consistency**: Do harmony scores make sense together?
2. **Literature comparison**: Do results match scholarly consensus?
3. **Sensitivity analysis**: How do results change with different scoring?

### Step 6: Expert Review

If possible:
- Domain expert review of scores
- Inter-rater reliability assessment
- Revision based on feedback

---

## Sensitivity Analysis Protocol

### Approach 1: Score Range Testing

For each score, test:
- **Conservative**: Score -0.1 (with minimum 0.0)
- **Liberal**: Score +0.1 (with maximum 1.0)

Recalculate K(t) for both scenarios.

### Approach 2: Harmony Weighting

Test alternative formulations:
- **Equal weight**: Standard geometric mean
- **Trust-weighted**: K(t) = (H₃² × H₁ × H₂ × H₄ × H₅ × H₆ × H₇)^(1/8)
- **Governance-weighted**: K(t) = (H₁² × H₂ × H₃ × H₄ × H₅ × H₆ × H₇)^(1/8)

### Approach 3: Evidence Quality Filtering

Compare results using:
- All evidence (including low confidence)
- High + Medium confidence only
- High confidence only

Report stability of findings across approaches.
