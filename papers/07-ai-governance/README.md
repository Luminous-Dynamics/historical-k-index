# Paper 7: AI Governance & Future Coordination

**Title**: "Coordinating the Uncoordinated: K-Index Analysis of AI Governance Readiness"

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q2 2027
**Target Journal**: Science or Nature

---

## Research Question

> Is humanity's coordination capacity sufficient to govern transformative AI, and what must we build?

---

## Key Analyses

### 1. Technology-Coordination Race
- Speed of AI capability advancement
- Speed of governance/coordination development
- Gap analysis: Is governance keeping pace?
- Historical analogues (nuclear, biotech, internet)

### 2. Required K(t) for AI Governance
- What coordination capacity is needed for:
  - AI safety standards
  - International AI agreements
  - Enforcement mechanisms
  - Benefit distribution
- Estimate required K(t) threshold

### 3. Current Governance Assessment
- Current AI governance landscape
- International coordination mechanisms
- Trust levels between AI developers/nations
- Institutional readiness

### 4. Gap Analysis
- Current K(t) vs required K(t) for AI
- Which harmonies are most deficient?
- Timeline before gap becomes critical

## AI Governance Requirements by Harmony

| Harmony | AI Governance Need |
|---------|-------------------|
| H₁ Governance | International AI treaties, regulatory bodies |
| H₂ Economic | Benefit sharing, market coordination |
| H₃ Trust | Trust between AI labs, nations, public |
| H₄ Complexity | Coordinated AI development, interoperability |
| H₅ Knowledge | AI safety research sharing, standards |
| H₆ Wellbeing | Just transition, displacement mitigation |
| H₇ Infrastructure | Computing governance, data commons |

## Governance Design Informed by K-Index

### Principles
- Match governance mechanisms to current K(t) level
- Don't design for K(t) we don't have
- Build K(t) alongside AI capability
- Prioritize H₃ investment

### Institutional Design Options
- **Low K(t) path**: National regulation, bilateral agreements
- **Medium K(t) path**: Regional blocs, voluntary standards
- **High K(t) path**: International treaty, global governance body

### Recommended Trajectory
- Current: Low K(t) mechanisms (realistic)
- Build: Trust infrastructure for AI cooperation
- Target: Medium K(t) mechanisms by 2030
- Aspire: High K(t) mechanisms by 2040

## Existential Risk Framing

### AI as Coordination Challenge
- AI risk is not just technical—it's coordinational
- Even "aligned" AI requires coordinated deployment
- Competitive dynamics undermine safety
- Trust deficit is the binding constraint

### Links to Collapse Studies (Paper 2)
- Technology-coordination mismatches in history
- Industrial Revolution coordination challenges
- Nuclear weapons coordination (partial success)
- What patterns predict governance failure?

## Expected Findings

1. **Hypothesis 1**: Current K(t) is insufficient for transformative AI governance
2. **Hypothesis 2**: H₃ (trust) between AI actors is critically low
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Governance institutions are 10-20 years behind capability
4. **Hypothesis 4**: $50B/year in coordination infrastructure could close the gap

## Why This Paper Matters

- Existential stakes
- Timely (AI development accelerating)
- Novel framing (AI as coordination problem)
- Actionable recommendations
- High-impact potential

---

## Data Requirements

- AI capability trajectories
- AI governance policy database
- Trust surveys among AI stakeholders
- International cooperation metrics
- AI safety research coordination data
- Historical technology governance cases

---

## Builds On

- Paper 1: Foundation (K-Index framework)
- Paper 2: Civilization Collapse (coordination failure consequences)
- Paper 3: Modern Fragility (current fragility baseline)
- Paper 5: Climate Gap (another coordination challenge)
- Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms (what interventions work)

## Sets Up

- Paper 8: Policy Framework (comprehensive recommendations)
