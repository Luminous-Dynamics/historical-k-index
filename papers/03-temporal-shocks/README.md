# Paper 3: Temporal Shocks and Resilience

**Status**: Planned for Q3 2026
**Journal Target**: Journal of Economic History or similar

## Research Question

How do global shocks (wars, pandemics, financial crises) impact coordination capacity, and which harmonies are most vulnerable?

## Key Hypotheses

1. **Differential Vulnerability**: H₃ (reciprocity) most fragile during crises
2. **Recovery Patterns**: H₅ (knowledge) recovers fastest
3. **Structural Breaks**: Some shocks create permanent shifts

## Data Requirements

- Event study methodology
- High-frequency K(t) estimates
- Shock dating (wars, pandemics, financial crises)
- Country-level resilience metrics

## Preliminary Findings

*To be developed after Paper 1 publication*

**Dependencies**:
- Builds on Papers 1-2
- Requires validated K(t) time series
- Uses same shared methodological framework
