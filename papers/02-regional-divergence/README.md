# Paper 2: Regional Divergence in Coordination Capacity

**Status**: Planned for Q2 2026
**Journal Target**: Regional Studies or similar

## Research Question

How do regional coordination capacities diverge, and what explains persistent gaps between developed and developing regions?

## Key Hypotheses

1. **Path Dependency**: Early industrialization creates lock-in effects
2. **Network Effects**: Regional clusters amplify coordination capacity
3. **Colonial Legacy**: Historical extraction patterns predict modern deficits

## Data Requirements

- Same H₁-H₇ framework as Paper 1
- Sub-national data where available
- Regional trade network analysis
- Historical institutional quality measures

## Preliminary Findings

*To be developed after Paper 1 publication*

**Dependencies**: 
- Builds on Paper 1 K-index framework
- Uses same shared data sources
- Extends to regional/sub-national analysis
