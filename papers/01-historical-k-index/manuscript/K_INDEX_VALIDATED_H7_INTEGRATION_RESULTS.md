VALIDATED H₇ INTEGRATION: MANUSCRIPT RESULTS UPDATE
================================================================================

**Date**: December 03, 2025
**Period**: 1996-2020 (25 years, overlap with validated H₇)

## Key Findings

### K(t) Index Comparison (Mean 1996-2020)

1. **Six-harmony K(t)** (H₁-H₆ only): 0.7156
2. **Seven-harmony K(t)** (synthetic H₇): 0.7186 (+0.41% vs six-harmony)
3. **Seven-harmony K(t)** (validated H₇): 0.6790 (-5.12% vs six-harmony)

### Impact of Validated H₇

**Mean difference** (validated vs synthetic): -0.049997 (-6.96%)

**Interpretation**: The validated H₇ component results in a lower K(t)
index compared to the synthetic H₇, with an average difference of 6.96% over
the 1996-2020 period.

### K(t) Values in 2020

- **Six-harmony K(t)₂₀₂₀**: 0.7689
- **Seven-harmony K(t)₂₀₂₀** (validated): 0.7265
- **Difference**: -0.042393 (-5.51%)

### Option 1: Full Description (~150 words)

For the period 1996-2020 where validated H₇ data are available, we compare three
K(t) formulations: six-harmony (H₁-H₆ only), seven-harmony with synthetic H₇
(HYDE-based), and seven-harmony with validated H₇ (World Bank empirical measures).

The validated seven-harmony K(t) shows a mean value of 0.6790 over this period,
representing a -5.12% decrease relative to the six-harmony
baseline (mean 0.7156). Compared to the synthetic H₇ approach (mean 0.7186),
the validated H₇ results in a mean difference of -0.049997 (-6.96%), indicating
weaker evolutionary progression when measured with direct empirical
indicators rather than demographic proxies.

In 2020, the validated seven-harmony K(t) reaches 0.7265, compared to 0.7689
for the six-harmony formulation, demonstrating that the inclusion of validated
evolutionary progression measures moderates the overall coherence assessment by
5.51%.

### Option 2: Concise Version (~50 words)

For 1996-2020, validated seven-harmony K(t) (mean 0.6790) differs from
synthetic H₇ formulation by -0.049997 (-6.96%), indicating weaker
evolutionary progression with empirical measures. K(t)₂₀₂₀ = 0.7265 (validated)
vs 0.7689 (six-harmony), demonstrating H₇'s 5.51% contribution.
