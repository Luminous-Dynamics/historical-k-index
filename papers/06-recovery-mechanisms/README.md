# Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms

**Title**: "Rebuilding Coordination Capacity: Lessons from Post-Collapse Recovery and Policy Interventions"

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q1 2027
**Target Journal**: Journal of Development Economics or World Politics

---

## Research Question

> What mechanisms rebuild coordination capacity after decline, and how can we accelerate recovery?

---

## Case Studies

### Historical Recovery Cases

#### 1. Post-WWII Western Europe (Marshall Plan)
- H₃ rebuilding through shared reconstruction
- Institutional design (ECSC → EU)
- Timeline: 1945-1960
- K(t) trajectory reconstruction

#### 2. Japan Post-1945
- Institutional reconstruction under occupation
- Economic miracle and social cohesion
- Timeline: 1945-1970
- Role of external intervention

#### 3. Post-Apartheid South Africa
- Truth and Reconciliation → H₃ recovery
- Institutional transformation (H₁)
- Challenges and limitations
- Timeline: 1994-present

#### 4. Post-Soviet Transitions
- Varied success across countries
- Why did some succeed and others fail?
- Compare Baltics vs Central Asia
- Role of EU integration (external H₃)

#### 5. Rwanda Post-Genocide
- Remarkable H₃ recovery from near-zero
- Gacaca courts and reconciliation
- Economic coordination rebuilding
- Timeline: 1994-present

### Modern Intervention Cases

#### 6. Nordic Social Capital Programs
- Deliberate trust-building policies
- Education, civic engagement, transparency
- Long-term maintenance of high H₃

#### 7. EU Integration Mechanisms
- How EU raised K(t) in member states
- Conditionality and institution-building
- Lessons for other regions

#### 8. Community-Based Reconciliation
- Local-level trust rebuilding
- Effectiveness data
- Scalability challenges

## Key Analyses

### 1. Recovery Patterns
- Which harmonies recover FIRST?
- Which take LONGEST? (Hypothesis: H₃)
- Minimum intervention threshold for recovery?
- Typical recovery timelines

### 2. Policy Mechanisms
| Policy Type | Primary Effect | Secondary Effects |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Economic redistribution | → H₆ | → H₃, H₂ |
| Institutional reform | → H₁ | → H₃, H₅ |
| Community programs | → H₃ | → H₁, H₆ |
| Infrastructure investment | → H₇ | → H₂, H₆ |
| Education reform | → H₅ | → H₃, H₄ |

### 3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
- $ per 0.01 K(t) improvement
- Compare mechanisms: which is most efficient?
- Timing: When is intervention most effective?
- Diminishing returns analysis

### 4. Lessons for Today
- If modern fragility increases, what's the playbook?
- Pre-emptive vs reactive interventions
- Building resilience vs responding to collapse
- Investment priorities

## Expected Findings

1. **Hypothesis 1**: H₃ (trust) recovery takes 2-3 generations
2. **Hypothesis 2**: External anchor institutions accelerate recovery
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Economic redistribution is most cost-effective for H₃
4. **Hypothesis 4**: Pre-emptive investment is 10x cheaper than post-collapse recovery

## Why This Paper Matters

- Provides HOPE (not just doom)
- Actionable policy prescriptions
- Evidence-based intervention design
- Completes the collapse → recovery arc

---

## Data Requirements

- Post-conflict recovery datasets
- Truth and reconciliation outcomes
- Marshall Plan documentation
- Nordic social capital program evaluations
- Community intervention effectiveness studies
- Economic recovery trajectories

---

## Builds On

- Paper 1: Foundation (K-Index framework)
- Paper 2: Civilization Collapse (what collapse looks like)
- Paper 3: Modern Fragility (current risks)
- Paper 4: Regional Divergence (where recovery is needed)
- Paper 5: Climate Gap (coordination challenges)

## Sets Up

- Paper 7: AI Governance (future coordination needs)
- Paper 8: Policy Framework (comprehensive recommendations)
