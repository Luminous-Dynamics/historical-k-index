# Paper 5: Climate Coordination Gap

**Title**: "The Climate Coordination Crisis: Measuring the Gap Between Required and Actual K-Index for Paris Agreement"

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q4 2026
**Target Journal**: Nature Climate Change

---

## Research Question

> How large is the coordination capacity gap for climate action, and what investments close it?

---

## Key Analyses

### 1. Required K(t) for Climate Action
- What level of coordination capacity is needed for Paris Agreement?
- What K(t) is required for 1.5°C target?
- What K(t) for 2°C target?
- Historical analogues (What K(t) enabled past collective action?)

### 2. Current vs Required Gap
- Current global K(t): ~0.91 (2020)
- Required K(t) for Paris: [estimate]
- Gap size and trajectory
- When does gap become unbridgeable?

### 3. Trust Infrastructure Investment
- H₃ is typically the bottleneck for climate cooperation
- What does H₃ investment look like?
- Cost of trust-building programs
- ROI of trust infrastructure vs technical infrastructure

### 4. Collapse Scenarios
- What happens if climate coordination fails?
- K(t) trajectory under climate stress
- Feedback loops between climate and coordination

---

## Climate-Coordination Framework

### Why Climate Needs Coordination
- Global commons problem
- Long time horizons (requires intergenerational trust)
- Unequal costs and benefits (requires H₃ for burden-sharing)
- Technical complexity (requires H₅ knowledge sharing)
- Massive infrastructure change (requires H₇ coordination)

### Which Harmonies Matter Most for Climate?
| Harmony | Climate Relevance |
|---------|-------------------|
| H₁ Governance | International agreements, enforcement |
| H₂ Economic | Carbon markets, green finance |
| H₃ Trust | Burden-sharing, compliance faith |
| H₄ Complexity | Technology transfer, adaptation |
| H₅ Knowledge | Climate science, solutions sharing |
| H₆ Wellbeing | Just transition, equity |
| H₇ Infrastructure | Energy grids, transport, adaptation |

---

## Investment Analysis

### Current Climate Investment
- ~$1T/year in climate mitigation
- Focused on H₇ (infrastructure)
- Minimal investment in H₃ (trust)

### Rebalancing Proposal
- What if 10% went to trust infrastructure?
- Estimated K(t) improvement
- Multiplier effects on cooperation

### Cost-Effectiveness Comparison
- $/ton CO₂ via technology
- $/ton CO₂ via coordination improvement
- Hypothesis: Trust investment has higher ROI

---

## Expected Findings

1. **Hypothesis 1**: Current K(t) is insufficient for Paris Agreement
2. **Hypothesis 2**: The gap is growing, not shrinking
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Trust (H₃) is the binding constraint
4. **Hypothesis 4**: $100B/year in trust infrastructure could close the gap

## Why This Paper Matters

- Frames climate as coordination problem (not just technology)
- Provides investment guidance
- Links to existential risk (Papers 2-3)
- Urgent and policy-relevant

---

## Data Requirements

- Climate commitment tracking data
- Climate finance flows
- Trust measures between climate actors
- Historical analogues of collective action
- Paris Agreement progress metrics

---

## Builds On

- Paper 1: Foundation (K-Index framework)
- Paper 2: Civilization Collapse (what happens if coordination fails)
- Paper 3: Modern Fragility (current fragility assessment)
- Paper 4: Regional Divergence (where coordination is weakest)

## Sets Up

- Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms (how to rebuild coordination)
- Paper 7: AI Governance (another coordination challenge)
- Paper 8: Policy Framework (comprehensive interventions)
