# Paper 3: Modern Fragility Assessment

**Title**: "Civilization Fragility in the 21st Century: A K-Index Early Warning Assessment"

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q2 2026
**Target Journal**: Science or Nature

---

## Research Question

> Does the current global coordination trajectory show warning signs similar to pre-collapse historical societies?

---

## Key Analyses

### 1. Modern K(t) Trajectory
- Post-2015 trends (after our historical dataset)
- Acceleration/deceleration of each harmony
- Structural imbalances widening or closing?

### 2. Comparison to Pre-Collapse Patterns
- Current H₃ (trust) trajectory vs Rome 300 CE, Soviet 1980s
- Governance fragmentation (H₁) trends
- Economic complexity concentration (H₄)
- Knowledge system polarization (H₅)

### 3. Fragility Indicators
- H₃ decline rate (trust erosion)
- H₁ legitimacy metrics (institutional trust)
- Harmony variance (imbalance severity)
- Interconnection fragility (H₂ dependency on few nodes)

### 4. Regional Fragility Map
- Which regions show collapse warning signs?
- Which regions are resilient?
- Contagion risk (if one region collapses, spread to others?)

### 5. Scenario Modeling
- **Business as usual**: K(t) trajectory if current trends continue
- **Stress scenarios**: Climate shock, pandemic, great power conflict
- **Intervention scenarios**: If we invest in H₃, what changes?

## Fragility Index Construction

**K-Index Fragility Score** (F):
```
F = f(dH₃/dt, H₁-H₃ correlation, variance of H₁-H₇, resilience indicators)
```

- Higher F = more fragile
- Compare to historical pre-collapse F values

## Modern Warning Signs to Investigate

### Political
- Democratic backsliding globally
- Rise of populism/nationalism
- Declining trust in institutions
- Polarization and fragmentation

### Economic
- Inequality and H₃ erosion
- Financial system fragility
- Supply chain concentration
- Debt sustainability

### Social
- Trust decline (survey data)
- Social cohesion metrics
- Polarization indices
- Mental health crisis (H₆ dimension)

### Technological
- AI/automation disruption potential
- Information ecosystem fragmentation
- Cybersecurity vulnerabilities
- Critical infrastructure dependencies

### Environmental
- Climate change acceleration
- Resource competition
- Biodiversity collapse
- Extreme weather coordination demands

## Expected Findings

1. **Hypothesis 1**: H₃ (trust) is declining in most developed democracies
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Fragility score is RISING despite GDP growth
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Current trajectory resembles pre-collapse patterns
4. **Hypothesis 4**: 10-20 year window for intervention before critical threshold

## Why This Paper Matters

- Creates urgency
- Directly relevant to policymakers
- Media attention potential
- Actionable warning

---

## Data Requirements

- Trust surveys (World Values Survey, Edelman Trust Barometer)
- Institutional quality (V-Dem, WGI extensions)
- Social cohesion metrics
- Polarization indices
- Economic fragility indicators

---

## Builds On

- Paper 1: Foundation (K-Index framework)
- Paper 2: Civilization Collapse (historical collapse patterns)

## Sets Up

- Paper 4: Regional Divergence (where are the vulnerable regions?)
- Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms (what can we do?)
