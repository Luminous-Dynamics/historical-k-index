# Paper 4: Regional Divergence

**Title**: "Coordination Inequality: Regional Divergence in Global Coordination Capacity (1990-2020)"

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Target**: Q3 2026
**Target Journal**: World Development or Regional Studies

---

## Research Question

> Which regions are coordination-fragile, and what explains divergence despite similar development?

---

## Key Analyses

### 1. Fragility-Focused Regional Mapping
- Build on Papers 2-3 collapse/fragility frameworks
- Apply K-Index Fragility Score (F) to all regions
- Identify HIGH-FRAGILITY zones

### 2. Vulnerability Identification
- Not just "different" but "vulnerable"
- Which regions show pre-collapse patterns?
- Early warning indicators by region

### 3. Coordination Contagion Analysis
- If one region collapses, who's at risk?
- Network interdependencies
- Financial, trade, and migration channels
- Information ecosystem links

### 4. Investment Priority Mapping
- Where does $1 of coordination investment have highest ROI?
- Which harmonies most need intervention by region?
- Cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions

---

## Regional Framework

### Regions to Analyze
- North America
- Western Europe
- Eastern Europe
- East Asia
- South Asia
- Southeast Asia
- Middle East & North Africa
- Sub-Saharan Africa
- Latin America
- Oceania

### Regional K(t) Profiles
For each region:
- K(t) trajectory (1990-2020)
- Harmony breakdown (H₁-H₇ contributions)
- Fragility score trend
- Key vulnerabilities

---

## Divergence Explanations

Why do regions with similar GDP have different K(t)?

### Candidate Factors
- Historical institutional legacies
- Colonial/post-colonial transitions
- Social capital traditions
- Geographic/resource constraints
- Recent policy choices
- External shocks and responses

---

## Expected Findings

1. **Hypothesis 1**: Trust (H₃) explains most regional divergence
2. **Hypothesis 2**: Historical institutions matter more than current GDP
3. **Hypothesis 3**: Some high-GDP regions are highly fragile
4. **Hypothesis 4**: Contagion risk is concentrated in specific networks

---

## Why This Paper Matters

- Identifies WHERE intervention is most needed
- Guides international development priorities
- Warns of contagion risks
- Enables targeted policy design

---

## Data Requirements

- All Paper 1 data disaggregated by region
- Regional trust surveys
- Institutional quality indices by country/region
- Trade and migration network data
- Financial interconnection data

---

## Builds On

- Paper 1: Foundation (K-Index framework)
- Paper 2: Civilization Collapse (what fragility looks like)
- Paper 3: Modern Fragility (global fragility assessment)

## Sets Up

- Paper 5: Climate Gap (regional climate coordination needs)
- Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms (region-specific interventions)
