# K-Index Research Program: 8-Paper Arc

**A Complete Theory of Civilizational Survival Through Coordination**

---

## The Central Insight

This research program answers a coherent sequence of existential questions:

1. What **IS** coordination capacity? (Foundation)
2. What **DESTROYS** it? (Collapse)
3. Are we at **RISK**? (Modern Fragility)
4. **WHERE** are weak points? (Regional)
5. What's the most **URGENT** threat? (Climate)
6. What **REBUILDS** it? (Recovery)
7. What's the **FUTURE** challenge? (AI)
8. How do we **INTERVENE** systematically? (Policy Framework)

## The 8 Papers

### Paper 1: Foundation - What IS Coordination Capacity?
**Title**: "Measuring Global Coordination Capacity: The K-Index Framework (1810-2020)"

**Contribution**:
- Establishes seven-harmony framework (H₁-H₇)
- Validates geometric mean integration
- 210-year historical baseline with 191,913 data points
- Identifies structural imbalance (1990-2020)

**Directory**: `01-historical-k-index/`

---

### Paper 2: Civilization Collapse - What DESTROYS Coordination?
**Title**: "Coordination Collapse and Civilizational Decline: A K-Index Analysis of Historical Societal Failures"

**Research Question**: What patterns of coordination failure preceded major civilization collapses, and which harmonies fail first?

**Case Studies**:
- Bronze Age Collapse (~1200 BCE)
- Western Roman Empire (300-500 CE)
- Maya Classic Period (~800-900 CE)
- Soviet Union (1989-1991)

**Key Findings**:
- Trust (H₃) threshold: θ ≈ 0.35-0.40
- Four Laws of Coordination Collapse
- Trust usually fails first, infrastructure last

**Directory**: `02-civilization-collapse/`

---

### Paper 3: Modern Fragility - Are We at RISK?
**Title**: "Civilization Fragility in the 21st Century: A K-Index Early Warning Assessment"

**Research Question**: Does the current global coordination trajectory show warning signs similar to pre-collapse historical societies?

**Key Analyses**:
- Post-2015 K(t) trajectory
- Comparison to pre-collapse patterns
- Regional fragility mapping
- Scenario modeling (stress tests)

**Directory**: `03-modern-fragility/`

---

### Paper 4: Regional Divergence - WHERE Are Weak Points?
**Title**: "Coordination Inequality: Regional Divergence in Global Coordination Capacity (1990-2020)"

**Research Question**: Which regions are coordination-fragile, and what explains divergence despite similar development?

**Key Analyses**:
- Fragility-focused regional analysis
- Contagion risk assessment
- Investment priority mapping

**Directory**: `04-regional-divergence/`

---

### Paper 5: Climate Gap - What's the URGENT Threat?
**Title**: "The Climate Coordination Crisis: Measuring the Gap Between Required and Actual K-Index for Paris Agreement"

**Research Question**: How large is the coordination capacity gap for climate action, and what investments close it?

**Key Analyses**:
- Required K(t) for Paris targets
- Current vs. required gap
- Investment ROI in trust infrastructure

**Directory**: `05-climate-gap/`

---

### Paper 6: Recovery Mechanisms - What REBUILDS Coordination?
**Title**: "Rebuilding Coordination Capacity: Lessons from Post-Collapse Recovery and Policy Interventions"

**Research Question**: What mechanisms rebuild coordination capacity after decline, and how can we accelerate recovery?

**Case Studies**:
- Post-WWII Western Europe (Marshall Plan)
- Post-apartheid South Africa
- Rwanda post-genocide
- Nordic social capital programs

**Directory**: `06-recovery-mechanisms/`

---

### Paper 7: AI Governance - What's the FUTURE Challenge?
**Title**: "Coordinating the Uncoordinated: K-Index Analysis of AI Governance Readiness"

**Research Question**: Is humanity's coordination capacity sufficient to govern transformative AI, and what must we build?

**Key Analyses**:
- Technology-coordination race
- International cooperation requirements
- Governance design informed by K-Index

**Directory**: `07-ai-governance/`

---

### Paper 8: Policy Framework - How Do We INTERVENE?
**Title**: "Building Planetary Coordination Capacity: A Policy Framework for the 21st Century"

**Research Question**: What comprehensive policy framework can systematically strengthen global coordination capacity?

**Synthesis**:
- Integrates insights from Papers 1-7
- Comprehensive policy recommendations
- Investment priorities (~$500B/year)
- Monitoring framework and accountability

**Directory**: `08-policy-framework/`

---

## The Narrative Arc

**Papers 1-3**: What is coordination, what destroys it, are we at risk?
**Papers 4-5**: Where are the weak points, what's most urgent?
**Papers 6-7**: How do we rebuild, what's coming next?
**Paper 8**: Comprehensive action framework
