# Extended Research Roadmap: Historical K-Index Program

**Strategic Vision**: Build comprehensive research program (Papers 1-7+) BEFORE major communication push
**Timeline**: 2025-2027 (3-year intensive research phase)
**Philosophy**: Commit to the work, keep collaboration door open, but don't depend on community traction

---

## Core Principle: Build the Body of Work First

**Why this approach?**
1. **Credibility**: Full research program demonstrates seriousness
2. **Coherence**: We control narrative and methodology across papers
3. **Momentum**: Don't wait for community - create it through excellence
4. **Communication**: Visual materials (dashboard, videos, infographics) should reflect COMPLETE vision

**Then**: Launch comprehensive communication campaign with full research foundation

## Paper 2: Regional Divergence & Coordination Inequality (Q2 2026)

### Research Question
**"Why do regions with similar economic development show drastically different coordination capacities, and what explains divergence trajectories?"**

### Scope Definition

#### Geographic Regions
1. **Western Europe** (High K, balanced harmonies)
2. **Nordic Countries** (Highest K, especially H₃)
3. **North America** (High tech H₇, lower trust H₃)
4. **East Asia** (Rising K, governance H₁ variation)
5. **Latin America** (Middle K, H₁ challenges)
6. **Sub-Saharan Africa** (Lower K, high variance)
7. **MENA** (Mixed K, governance constraints)
8. **South Asia** (Rising but uneven)

#### Key Analyses

**1. Divergence Patterns (1990-2020)**
- Which regions converged in K(t)?
- Which diverged despite similar GDP growth?
- Role of each harmony (H₁-H₇) in divergence

**2. Coordination Inequality**
- Gini coefficient for K(t) across countries
- Trends: Is coordination capacity becoming more/less equal?
- Comparison to income inequality trends

**3. Development-Coordination Decoupling**
- Countries with high GDP, low K(t) (e.g., resource-rich autocracies)
- Countries with moderate GDP, high K(t) (e.g., Costa Rica, Uruguay)
- What explains decoupling?

**4. Regional Bottleneck Analysis**
- Which harmony limits each region?
- Western Europe: Often H₃ (trust declining)
- North America: H₃ (polarization)
- East Asia: H₁ (governance quality variation)
- Latin America: H₁ and H₃
- Sub-Saharan Africa: H₁, H₄, H₇
- MENA: H₁ (institutional constraints)

**5. Path Dependence**
- Colonial legacies and coordination capacity
- Post-conflict trajectories
- Democratic transitions and K(t) changes

#### Methodology
- **Panel analysis**: Fixed effects models for regional trends
- **Clustering**: Identify coordination regimes (not just geographic regions)
- **Decomposition**: Variance decomposition (within-region vs between-region)
- **Case studies**: 3-4 deep dives on divergence stories
  - Example: Nordic countries vs Southern Europe (similar income, different K)
  - Example: East Asian tigers vs Latin American economies

#### Data Requirements
- All H₁-H₇ data (already have H₇ for 159 countries)
- Need to extend H₁-H₆ country-level coverage (currently global aggregates)
- Regional aggregations from existing data sources

#### Target Journal
**Regional Studies** or **World Development**
- Focuses on regional disparities
- Policy-relevant
- Open to novel metrics

#### Expected Findings
- **Hypothesis 1**: Coordination inequality INCREASED post-1990 (unlike income inequality which varies)
- **Hypothesis 2**: High-income regions can have declining K(t) (Western democracies losing trust)
- **Hypothesis 3**: Development-coordination decoupling is widening
- **Hypothesis 4**: Regional bottlenecks are persistent (path-dependent)

#### Policy Implications
- Development aid should target coordination bottlenecks, not just income
- Regional integration requires harmony alignment (not just trade agreements)
- Trust infrastructure (H₃) is critical for sustained development

## Paper 3: Temporal Shocks & Coordination Resilience (Q3 2026)

### Research Question
**"How do major shocks (wars, pandemics, financial crises, climate events) affect coordination capacity, and what determines resilience?"**

### Scope Definition

#### Major Shocks to Analyze
1. **WWI (1914-1918)**: Coordination collapse
2. **WWII (1939-1945)**: Deepest K(t) decline
3. **Post-WWII Recovery (1945-1960)**: Coordination rebuilding
4. **1970s Oil Shocks**: Economic coordination stress
5. **End of Cold War (1989-1991)**: Regime transitions
6. **Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998)**: Regional shock
7. **9/11 & War on Terror (2001-2003)**: Security coordination shift
8. **2008 Financial Crisis**: Economic coordination test
9. **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2022)**: Ultimate coordination stress test
10. **Climate Events** (various): Droughts, hurricanes, floods

#### Key Analyses

**1. Shock Typology**
- Economic shocks vs Security shocks vs Health shocks vs Climate shocks
- Which harmonies does each type affect most?
- Immediate impact vs Long-term effects

**2. Resilience Patterns**
- Time to recovery (half-life of K(t) decline)
- Which countries/regions bounce back faster?
- Role of pre-shock K(t) in determining resilience

**3. Coordination Scarring**
- Do some shocks permanently reduce K(t)?
- WWI & WWII → trust deficits lasting decades
- 2008 crisis → institutional legitimacy erosion
- COVID-19 → polarization acceleration

**4. Harmony-Specific Impacts**
- Wars → H₃ (trust) and H₁ (governance) collapse
- Economic crises → H₂ (interconnection) stress, H₆ (wellbeing) decline
- Pandemics → H₁ (institutions) tested, H₃ (trust) revealed
- Climate events → H₇ (infrastructure) damaged, H₆ affected

**5. Recovery Mechanisms**
- What policies/institutions enable fast K(t) recovery?
- Marshall Plan → H₃ rebuilding through shared prosperity
- EU integration → H₁ and H₂ strengthening
- Post-COVID: Which countries restored coordination? Why?

#### Methodology
- **Event study design**: Compare K(t) trajectories before/after shocks
- **Difference-in-differences**: Affected vs unaffected regions
- **Synthetic control**: Counterfactual K(t) without shock
- **Survival analysis**: Time-to-recovery modeling

#### Data Requirements
- High-frequency K(t) estimates (annual, not just decadal)
- Need to construct K(t) for shock periods with limited data
- May require interpolation or proxy methods for war periods

#### Target Journal
**Journal of Economic History** or **Economic History Review**
- Historical analysis focus
- Accepts novel metrics
- Policy implications welcome

#### Expected Findings
- **Hypothesis 1**: Trust (H₃) takes longest to recover from shocks
- **Hypothesis 2**: Pre-shock K(t) level predicts resilience
- **Hypothesis 3**: Some shocks create permanent coordination deficits
- **Hypothesis 4**: Institutions (H₁) are key to rapid recovery

#### Policy Implications
- Build coordination capacity BEFORE crises (resilience investment)
- Post-crisis recovery should prioritize H₃ (trust rebuilding)
- International coordination mechanisms needed for global shocks
