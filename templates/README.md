## How to Use These Templates

### Step 1: Choose Your Template
- **Policy Brief**: If you're trying to influence decision-making
- **Teaching Module**: If you're educating others about coordination science

### Step 2: Download and Open
```bash
# Clone repository if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/historical-k-index.git
cd historical-k-index/templates

# Open in your favorite editor
# Replace [BRACKETED TEXT] with your specific content
```

### Step 3: Customize for Your Context
- Replace placeholder text with your specifics
- Adapt examples to your domain (climate, health, governance, etc.)
- Use actual K-Index data from the repository
- Add your own case studies and references

### Step 4: Access Supporting Data
All templates reference the Historical K-Index data:
```bash
# Data location
../shared/data/processed/

# Key files:
# - K_index_time_series_1810_2020.csv
# - H7_evolutionary_progression.csv
# - [Other harmony-specific files]
```

### Step 5: Share Your Work!
After completing your policy brief or teaching a class:
- Share outcomes via GitHub Discussions
- Contribute improved templates back to the repository
- Help others learn from your experience

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Climate Policy Brief
**Goal**: Convince your city council to invest in community climate forums

**Steps**:
1. Open `POLICY_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Replace policy domain with "Municipal Climate Action"
3. Use H₃ data to show trust deficit in your city
4. Propose 3 community forum interventions
5. Calculate cost (~$500K) and coordination return
6. Present to city council

**Time**: 2 days
**Impact**: Potential $500K investment in trust infrastructure

---

### Example 2: University Course
**Goal**: Teach coordination science to economics undergraduates

**Steps**:
1. Open `TEACHING_MODULE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. Choose Option A (single 75-minute session) for pilot
3. Assign readings (PARADIGM_SHIFT.md, FAQ.md)
4. Run K-Index calculation workshop
5. Facilitate policy implications discussion
6. Collect student feedback

**Time**: 4 hours prep, 75 minutes delivery
**Impact**: 30 students understand coordination paradigm

### Example 3: Workshop for NGO
**Goal**: Train climate advocates on K-Index framework

**Steps**:
1. Adapt both templates for 3-hour workshop
2. Part 1: Teach framework (30 min)
3. Part 2: Calculate K-Index (45 min)
4. Part 3: Draft policy brief (90 min)
5. Part 4: Present briefs (15 min)

**Time**: 1 day prep, 3 hours delivery
**Impact**: 20 advocates equipped with K-Index tools
