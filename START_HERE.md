## 🎯 The One Key Finding (Memorize This)

> **"Validated H₇ produces -7.0% lower K(t) than synthetic approach"**

**Why this matters**: It demonstrates **empirical rigor over methodological optimism**.

Instead of inflating results to support our hypothesis, we honestly report that direct empirical measurement reveals **more conservative** evolutionary progression than demographic proxies suggested.

**This strengthens scientific credibility**, not weakens it.
