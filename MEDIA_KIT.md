**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

### New Research Framework Reveals Why We're Failing on Climate Despite Having the Technology

*K-Index measures global "coordination capacity" - and finds critical trust deficit limiting climate action*

**[YOUR CITY], December 3, 2025** – A new research program introduces the K-Index, a comprehensive measure of humanity's ability to coordinate at global scale, revealing a critical imbalance: while our technological capacity has surged 18% since 1990, our trust infrastructure has grown only 12% – creating a coordination crisis that explains climate inaction despite having solutions.

"We've been measuring the wrong things," explains lead researcher Tristan Stoltz. "GDP tells us how much we produce. The K-Index tells us whether we can cooperate. For climate change, cooperation matters more than production."

The K-Index integrates seven dimensions of global coordination capacity (governance, interconnection, trust, complexity, knowledge, wellbeing, and technology) into a single metric. Analysis of 210 years of data (1810-2020) reveals that post-1990 growth was structurally imbalanced: we built digital infrastructure but under-invested in trust-building institutions.

**Key Finding**: Climate action requires high levels of trust-intensive cooperation (H₃ in the framework), but this is precisely the dimension that has lagged most – creating what researchers call "the climate coordination paradox."

**Policy Implication**: Redirecting even 5% of climate finance (~$50 billion annually) from technology to trust-building could yield higher coordination returns than pure technology investments.

The research program, published as open science on GitHub with full replication data, represents a paradigm shift from measuring individual prosperity to measuring collective capability.

## 🎯 Key Messages for Media

### The One-Sentence Pitch
"The K-Index measures humanity's ability to coordinate at global scale – and reveals we've built the wrong infrastructure for climate action."

### The Three-Sentence Summary
"The 21st century's biggest challenges are coordination problems, not production problems. The K-Index measures global coordination capacity through seven dimensions – and finds a critical trust deficit. We have the technology to solve climate change; we lack the trust infrastructure to coordinate action."

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"We measure GDP to track economic production. But climate change, pandemics, and AI governance require coordination, not just production. The K-Index is the first comprehensive measure of global coordination capacity. Analysis of 210 years shows we've massively under-invested in trust infrastructure – the foundation for climate cooperation. It's like building highways without traffic lights: the infrastructure exists, but it can't function safely."

## 🎤 Interview Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the K-Index?**
A: The K-Index is a comprehensive measure of humanity's ability to coordinate at planetary scale. It integrates seven fundamental dimensions – governance, interconnection, trust, complexity, knowledge, wellbeing, and technology – into a single 0-1 metric. Think of it as "GDP for cooperation."

**Q: Why do we need another development metric? Isn't GDP enough?**
A: GDP measures how much we produce. But the 21st century's biggest challenges – climate change, pandemics, AI governance – are coordination problems, not production problems. We have the wealth and technology; we struggle to coordinate action. You can't manage what you don't measure.

**Q: What did your research find?**
A: Two key findings. First, global coordination capacity has increased 6-fold since 1810, but with major setbacks during world wars. Second, post-1990 growth was structurally imbalanced: we invested heavily in technology and digital infrastructure but under-invested in trust-building institutions. This creates a coordination crisis for climate action.

**Q: How does this relate to climate change?**
A: Climate action requires trust-intensive cooperation – what we call H₃ in the framework. But H₃ is precisely the dimension that's lagged most. We've built incredible technology (H₇) but haven't built the trust infrastructure needed to coordinate its deployment. It's like having a powerful car but no roads.

**Q: What should policymakers do differently?**
A: Rebalance climate finance. Current allocation is roughly 95% technology, 5% capacity building. Our analysis suggests 60% technology, 40% trust infrastructure would yield better coordination returns. Invest in community climate forums, shared benefit mechanisms, cross-border cooperation – the social infrastructure for coordination.

**Q: Is this just theoretical, or can it guide real policy?**
A: Highly actionable. The K-Index can diagnose exactly which dimension limits a country's coordination capacity. For instance, if H₃ (trust) is the bottleneck, invest there – not in more technology. It's targeted intervention based on data, not guesswork.

**Q: How is this different from the Human Development Index (HDI)?**
A: HDI measures individual wellbeing (income, education, health). K-Index measures collective capability (can we cooperate?). They're complementary but distinct. You can have high HDI with low K-Index (wealthy but fragmented society) or vice versa.

**Q: Why make this open source?**
A: Science advances fastest when everyone can build on it. We've published full data (191,913 observations), complete code, and comprehensive documentation. Any researcher can replicate, critique, or extend our work. That's how you build a research program, not just a paper.

**Q: What's next for this research?**
A: This is Paper 1 of a trilogy. Paper 2 will analyze regional divergence in coordination capacity. Paper 3 will study how shocks (wars, pandemics, crises) affect coordination resilience. Beyond that, we invite the research community to propose Papers 4, 5, 6+ applying the framework to specific domains.

**Q: Is this relevant beyond climate change?**
A: Absolutely. Pandemic preparedness requires international cooperation (high H₃). AI governance requires institutional quality (high H₁). Financial stability requires interconnection (high H₂). Any challenge requiring global coordination can be analyzed through the K-Index lens.

**Q: What's the ultimate goal?**
A: By 2050, we envision the K-Index as a standard metric – tracked like GDP, used by policymakers, taught in schools. When we optimize for coordination capacity instead of just production, we might finally tackle the challenges that threaten planetary survival.

### For Policymakers
**Subject**: New metric for climate policy: coordination capacity, not just technology

Dear [Name],

Given your work on [policy area], I wanted to share research that may inform [specific policy initiative].

We've developed the K-Index to measure global coordination capacity – and found that climate policy may be misallocating resources.

**Key finding**: Post-1990 growth prioritized technology (↑18%) over trust infrastructure (↑12%). But climate action requires trust-intensive cooperation – precisely the lagging dimension.

**Policy implication**: Rebalancing even 5% of climate finance (~$50B/year) from pure technology to trust-building could yield higher coordination returns.

The K-Index can diagnose specific bottlenecks by country/region, enabling targeted interventions.

Full methodology, data (191,913 points), validation: [repo link]

Happy to discuss applications to [specific policy context].

Respectfully,
Tristan Stoltz
